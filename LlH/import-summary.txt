ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project SMSSDK:F:\SMSSDK\2.0.1\SMSSDK\SMSSDK\.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project SMSSDK: ignored. The project may
   not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => sMSSDK\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\MobCommons.jar => sMSSDK\libs\MobCommons.jar
* libs\MobTools.jar => sMSSDK\libs\MobTools.jar
* libs\SMSSDK-2.0.1.jar => sMSSDK\libs\SMSSDK-2.0.1.jar
* res\ => sMSSDK\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
